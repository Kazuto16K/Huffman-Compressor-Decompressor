## Huffman Coding File Compression and Decompression Website

This website provides a user-friendly interface for compressing text files into binary files using Huffman coding, a popular algorithm for data compression. It also supports the decompression of binary files back into their original text format.

### - Features:
  - File Compression: Upload text files to the website, which then applies Huffman coding to generate compressed binary files. Huffman coding ensures efficient compression by assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring characters.

  - File Decompression: Upload previously compressed binary files to decompress them back into their original text format. The website reconstructs the original files using the same Huffman coding scheme used for compression.

  - User Interface: An intuitive web interface allows users to easily upload files, initiate compression or decompression processes, and download the resulting files.
